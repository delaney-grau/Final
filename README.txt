FinalProject_Grau - Employment and Wage Trends Analysis
======================================================

Author: Delaney Grau  
Date: 2025-05-29

Project Overview
----------------
This project investigates changes in employment levels and wage gaps across major U.S. job sectors from 2015 to 2024, with special focus on post-COVID-19 trends and the impact of AI technologies. The analysis uses public datasets from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and Occupational Employment Statistics (OES). Methods include data cleaning, inflation adjustment, time-series modeling, and visualization.

Instructions for Replicating Results
------------------------------------
1. Download or clone the project folder.
2. Ensure all necessary Python libraries are installed:
   - pandas
   - numpy
   - matplotlib
   - seaborn
   - (others as listed in the notebook/script)
3. Place the provided data files into the `input_data/` directory:
   - `Book 1.xlsx` (BLS industry/sector employment data)
   - `OES_Report (6).xlsx` (OES occupation-based employment data)
4. Open the Jupyter notebook in the `code/` directory and run all cells sequentially, or execute the Python script if provided.
5. Output tables, plots, and results will be generated in the `output_data/` directory.

Descriptions of Scripts and Non-Code Files
------------------------------------------
- **code/mock6.ipynb**:  
  Colab notebook containing all code for data import, cleaning, analysis, and visualization.  
- **code/mock6.py** (optional):  
  Python script version of the notebook for reproducibility outside Jupyter.  
- **ReadMe.txt**:  
  This file. Project documentation and instructions.
- **input_data/Book 1.xlsx**:  
  Contains industry/sector employment information from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
- **input_data/OES_Report (6).xlsx**:  
  Contains employment data by occupation from the Occupational Employment Statistics survey.
- **output_data/**:  
  Directory for output files generated by the code (tables, plots, summary statistics). Empty by default.

Descriptions of Data Outputs
----------------------------
All files in `output_data/` are generated by running the notebook/script. Typical outputs include:
- **sector_employment_trends.png**: Plot of employment level trends by sector.
- **wage_gap_table.csv**: Table summarizing average wage gaps across sectors or occupations.
- **forecast_vs_actual.png**: Visualization comparing model forecasts to actual employment/wage data.
- **summary_statistics.txt**: Text file containing key metrics and model results.

Variable Definitions

| occupation_code     | string  | OES occupation code (e.g., 29-1141)                       |
| occupation_title    | string  | Occupation name (e.g., Registered Nurses)                 |
| employment          | int     | Number of people employed in industry or occupation        |
| avg_wage            | float   | Average annual or hourly wage (USD, inflation-adjusted)    |
| sector              | string  | Broad industry sector                                     |
| cpi                 | float   | Consumer Price Index (if used for inflation adjustment)    |
